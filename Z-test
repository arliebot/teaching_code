# Z Test

# Since we found that R doesn't have a built-in function for Z, let's write one!

z.test <- function(dat, mu, sigma) {
    numerator <- mean(dat) - mu
    denominator <- sigma / sqrt(length(x))
    z <- numerator / denominator
    return(z)
}

# Test it with some data:
x <- rnorm(200)
mu <- .25
sigma <- 1

z.test(x, mu, sigma)

# Some issues:
    # would crash if X has any missing data
    # doesn't return p-value
    # doesn't return confidence interval
